MovieApp (iOS - Swift & UIKit)
Welcome to MovieApp, an iOS application built with Swift and UIKit. MovieApp allows users to search for movies online using an API and store their favorite movies. The app provides a seamless and intuitive user experience, enabling users to discover and manage their movie preferences effortlessly.

Features
Movie Search: MovieApp provides a powerful search feature that allows users to search for movies by entering the movie title. The app leverages an API to fetch relevant movie details and presents them to the user in an organized manner.

Favorite Movies: Users can mark movies as their favorites by tapping the "Add to Favorites" button displayed with each movie. This allows users to easily access and manage their favorite movies within the app.
